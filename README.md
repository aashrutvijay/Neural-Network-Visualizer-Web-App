# Neural-Network-Visualizer-Web-App

Web based visualization of neural network prediction using keras and streamlit, created while taking a coursera course on the same.

These were the obejectives of the project.

  1. Create a model server with Flask and Keras
  2. Create a web application with Streamlit
  3. Utilize Keras' functional API

The Neural Network Visualizer Web Application  visualize's the Input Layer, Hidden Layer and Output Layer on the MNIST Dataset.

The application obtains a random picture from the MNIST dataset and visualizes the neural network's 3 layers.
