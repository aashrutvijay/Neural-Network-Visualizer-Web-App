# Neural-Network-Visualizer-Web-App

Web based visualization of neural network prediction using keras and streamlit, created while taking a coursera course on the same

These were the obejectives of the project
-Create a model server with Flask and Keras
-Create a web application with Streamlit
-Utilize Keras' functional API

A Neural Network Visualizer Web Application To Visualize The Input Layer, Hidden Layer and Output Layer on the MNIST Dataset.

The application obtains a random picture from the MNIST dataset and visualizes the neural network's 3 layers.
